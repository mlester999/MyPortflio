                Editor</h2>
                <p>Good Day! My name is Mark Lester T. Acak.
                    I’d like to take a couple of minutes to tell you why hiring me as your Full Stack Developer
                    will benefit your company. I’m very good at academics when I’m studying and I’m very happy
                    in what am I doing. I am very passionate at my position and I’d like to take this to your company.
                    I’m also extremely motivated in work and in my personal life because of my family and my wife.
                    I'm versatile in every aspects and areas of work. I’m not just good at doing this but also
                    I want to learn new things while working. </p><br>
                    <p>Currently, I am actively looking for career in a good company as I always have the passion
                    to work about gaming. My past job was in Sony Computer Entertainment as a Game Tester for 3 years.
                    I build up a lot in this company and this is where I improved the most. The responsibilities that
                    I learned here is maintaining relationships with co-workers. My contributions to the company were
                    very big and that helps them to stay consistent. My skills, knowledge, and attitude played crucial role
                    in achieving this. </p> <br>
